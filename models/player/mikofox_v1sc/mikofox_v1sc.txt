Miko Fox Model for Unreal Tournament 2004 and soon once again for Half life (Sven coop mod)

This little Foxette is uses a moddified little Eris body as her base and a whole new head and tail for the rest.

Credit where credit is due

Original Body Model - Hide
Body editing and reconfiguration - Miko

Do not moddify this model without proper promission.
Ask hide on promission on modifying the little eris model.
