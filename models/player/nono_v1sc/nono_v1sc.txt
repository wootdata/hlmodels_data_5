Description : 

This model is a totally funny model.
It's a kind of human mixed with a sort of penguin and even Pinocchio (For the nose !!).
Only god knows why he's dressed with a black jacket and a bow tie.
His right foot was taken from a duck!
His left leg was even taken from Long John Silver (a famous Corsair), it's a wood leg.
Uh, oh ! I forget to mention that this leg was animated like a normal leg !
(Very funny ! )


Info :

It was created with Milkshape from Chumbalum Soft.
I also used Paint shop Pro and even MsPaint to make the skin.
Thankz to Scarecrow from Coldfusion for his great tutorials !
